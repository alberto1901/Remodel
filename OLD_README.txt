RELEASE: 20070311  -- added default material attributes for *.ac output
RELEASE: 20070217  -- initial release
====================================================
ABOUT THIS PROGRAM
Remodel is a command line Ruby script to convert *.obj models to *.ac format. It was primarily written to convert *.obj models exported from Wings3D (http://www.wings3d.com) in order to use them in FlightGear (http://www.flightgear.org). Other *.obj models should work OK. Not all *.obj characteristics are accounted for because *.ac format does not handle them.

By default, material texture file names, if present in the model, will be changed to use an 'rgb' extension. This can be overridden by using the -ext parameter. Note that this program will not change the texture files themselves. You'll need to do that yourself. Also, if for some perverse reason you insist on using *.bmp graphic files in FG, note that the *.bmp files have a reversed vertical axis. So, you'll need to flip your images in the vertical dimension to use them.

The input model file name must have a 'obj' extension. The output file name must have either an 'ac' or an 'obj' extension. (Converting *.obj to *.obj sometimes helps with debugging.) The materials definition *.mtl file should be in the same directory as the *.obj file.

While not absolutely essential, it is helpful if your *.obj model is triangulated before converting. The conversion program does no tessellation, but FlightGear (well, plib, I think) doesâ€”sometimes with erroneous results. Also note that typically in *.obj format the x vector is longitudinal, z is transverse and y is vertical. In *.ac format x is longitudinal, z is vertical and y is transverse. Wings3D has an *obj export option to switch the y and z axes. Other modeling applications may not have this feature and you'll need to roll your model 90 degrees.

====================================================
USAGE

If convert.rb is executable and calls the Ruby interpreter:
	[path]convert.rb [path]input_model.obj [path]output_model.ac [-ext=xxx]

If you need to explicitly call the Ruby interpreter:
	[path]ruby [path]convert.rb [path]input_model.obj [path]output_model.ac [-ext=xxx]

====================================================
PREREQUISITES
You must have the Ruby interpreter installed and running in your environment.

====================================================
INSTALLATION
Uncompress the files. You may need to edit the shebang line in convert.rb to point to your Ruby installation. In Windows, you'll want to associate the 'rb' file extension with the Ruby interpreter.
